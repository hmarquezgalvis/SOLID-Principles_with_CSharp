# SOLID Principles

Practice about use of SOLID principles.

# [S]ingle Responsability Principle (SRP)

Every module/class should have only one reason to change. This means that every class or similar structure in the code should have only one job to do.

# [O]pen / Close Principle (OCP)

A module/class is open for extension and closed for midifications.

# [L]iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification.

# [I]nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)

that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one sub module.

# [D]ependency Inversion Principla (DIP)

this principle states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
